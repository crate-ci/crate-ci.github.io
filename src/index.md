# crate-ci

In Rust, there is a tendency towards a lot of small crates.  The challenge with
that is the overhead of maintaining a crate, from managing issues to releases.

The goal of this guide is to help you successfully manage your [Rust][rust]
crates with minimal overhead.

- [Managing PRs](pr.html)

- [Managing Releases](release.html)

- [Wrangling Dependencies](dependencies.html)
