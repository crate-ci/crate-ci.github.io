Crate CI: Simplifying Crate management

## Using

If you'd like to read the `crate-ci` docs, you can visit
[https://crate-ci.github.io](https://crate-ci.github.io) to read it online.

If you'd like to read it locally, [install Rust], and then:

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook
$ git clone https://github.com/crate-ci/crate-ci.github.io
$ cd crate-ci.github.io
$ mdbook build
$ mdbook serve
```

[install Rust]: http://rust-lang.org/install.html

To be able to run the examples, you must be connected to the internet; you can
read all content offline, however!
